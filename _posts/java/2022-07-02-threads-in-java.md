Like people, computers can multitask. They can be working on several different tasks at the same time. A computer that has just a single central processing unit can't do two things at the same time, but it can still switch its attention back and forth among several tasks. Right now computer has more processing units which means they can work on several tasks simultaneously. To use the these multiprocessing computers, we can do **parallel programming**. In other words we can write a program (composed of several tasks) that can be executed simultaneoulsy.

  <h4 class="table-of-contents-title">Contents</h4>

 <hr class="horizontal-line">
</nav>

Unfortunately, parallel programming is even more difficult than single-threaded programming. We can counter a whole new category of errors. Fortunately Java provides nice API to work with threads easily. In this long blog we are going to learn basics of the thread in the context of Java programming.

## Threads

In Java, **a single task is called a thread**

The term thread refers to a thread of control meaning that **a sequence of instructions that are executed one after another.**

Every Java program has at least one thread. When the Java virtual machine runs our program it creates thread that is responsible for executing the **main** routing of the program.

### Creating and running threads

In Java, a thread is represented by an object belonging to the class (or subclass of this called) called: `java.lang.Thread`

The purpose of **Thread** object is to execute a single method and to execute it just once. Single method represents the task to be done by the thread. The method is executed in its own thread of control.

When the execution of the thread's method is finished (either normally or throwing exception(s)), there is no way to restart the thread or to use the same **Thread** object to start another thread.

#### Creating thread(s) using Thread class

We create thread by extending `Thread` class and define the method called `run()` in the subclass.

`run()` method defines the task that will be performed by the thread, when the thread is started the `run()` method will be executed in the thread.

```java
public class AnyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread execution");
    }
}
```

If we want to use `AnyThread`, we have to create an object:

```java
AnyThread anyThread = new AnyThread();
```

However, creating the object does not automatically start the thread (or call the run method). We have to call the `start()` method in the thread object:

```java
anyThread.start();
```

The purpose of the `start()` method is to create the new thread of control that will execute the Thread objectâ€™s `run()` method. The new thread runs with any other threads that already existed.

The `start()` method returns immediately after starting the new thread of control **without waiting for the thread to terminate**. This means that the code in the thread's `run()` method executes at the same time as the statements that follow after the call to the `start()` method. For instance:

```java
AnyThread anyThread = new AnyThread();
anyThread.start();
System.out.println("Main method print");
```

After `anyThread.start()` is executed, there are 2 threads. One of them will print **Main method print** and the other will print **Thread execution**. The most important point is that these messages can be printed in random manner. Because 2 threads run simultaneously and will fight each other to access standart output. Whichever thread happens to be the first to get access will be the first to print its message.

<img src="/assets/java/threads_in_java/multi_thread_uncertainty.png" alt="multi_thread_uncertainty.png">

Note: If we were call the `run()` directly instead of `start()`, then `run` method would be run in the same thread. Therefore calling the run or start are so different things ...

#### Creating thread(s) using Runnable interface

We can also create a thread by implementing the interface called `java.lang.Runnable` which defines a single method called `public void run()`. With a given runnable, we can create a Thread whose work is to execute the Runnable's run method. We will give the our Runnable implementation to the Thread in the constructor.

```java
public class AnyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable execution");
    }
}
```

```java
AnyRunnable anyRunnable = new AnyRunnable();
Thread thread = new Thread(anyRunnable);
thread.start();
System.out.println("Main method print");

// Because Runnable is a functional interface we can also create Runnable object with lambda expression
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Runnable execution"));
System.out.println("Main method print");
thread.start();
```

The disadvantage of the Runnable way, it violates the single responsibility for the object.

## What happens if we have only one processing unit(CPU)?

Even we have one processing unit, we can create many threads as we want. But in this time, all running threads will fight each other for time on the processor and only one thread will run its code at time **t**. Even in this case there is uncertainty, because we can't know when the processor switch from one thread to another.(It can be done at unpredictable times)

Actually in the point of view of the programmer, there is no difference between for single CPU or multi-core CPU.

## Example program

To understand threads, let's go to the sample example. In our example, we are going to create many threads each of them will count the prime numbers between **[2, 5000000]**

```java
public class CountPrimeThread extends Thread {
    private final static int MAX = 5000000;

    private final String id;

    public CountPrimeThread(int id) {
        this.id = "Thread ID: " + id;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        int count = countPrimes(2, MAX);
        long elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        System.out.println( id + " counted " +
                count + " primes in " + (elapsedTime/1000.0) + " seconds.");
    }

    private int countPrimes(int min, int max) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = min; i <= max; i++)
            if (isPrime(i))
                count++;
        return count;
    }

    private boolean isPrime(int x) {
        if (x <= 1) return false;
        int top = (int)Math.sqrt(x);
        for (int i = 2; i <= top; i++)
            if ( x % i == 0 )
                return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```

In the main method we are just creating the threads and running them:

```java
public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numberOfThreads = 10;
        System.out.println("Creating " + numberOfThreads + " threads...");
        CountPrimeThread[] worker = new CountPrimeThread[numberOfThreads];
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++)
            worker[i] = new CountPrimeThread( i );
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++)
            worker[i].start();
        System.out.println("Threads have been created and started.");
    }
}
```

Here the sample output from my computer:

```text
Creating 10 threads...

```

The second line (**Threads have been created and started.** ) was printed immediately. At this point main program(main thread) has ended but the other 10 threads continued to run. After (almost) 4 seconds, all threads completed their run methods. But the order in which the threads complete is not the same as the order in which they were started, and the order is indeterminate. That means if we run the application again the order could be (probably) different. Now let me show you the output with different thread numbers:

According to the outputs, it seems using the less threads(especially <8) takes little time. Actually the reason is related to the my computer. Because my computer has 8 CPUs (you can learn the number of CPUs by running the command `lscpu` on your linux system), if i increase the number of threads more than 8, then threads will fight each other to run their codes on the CPUs. And definitely one (or more threads) will wait for other threads. Therefore it will take more times. (IMPORTANT NOTE: **Even creating the 2 threads, operating system may run the threads on one CPU -even there are 8 CPUs available!!!-, we can't know exactly what would happen !!!** ). Each processor runs one thread for a a while then switches to another thread(**context switches**) and runs that one for a while and so on...

Now, let's look at the Thread and related class called Runtime

## Operations on Threads

We can find the available processor by calling methods on the Runtime class. We may use the Runtime class on Java program to get information about the environment in which it is running. Here is the code for available processors:

```java
public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numberOfCPUs = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        System.out.println("Number of CPUs: " + numberOfCPUs);
    }
}
```

> Actually `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()` returns the number of processors available to the JVM. Therefore sometimes number from the method could be different than number of CPU in the system

---

Once a thread has been started, it will continue to run until its `run()` method ends.

### isAlive

We can get whether the thread is alive or not by calling `isAlive()` method. (For instance: `anyThread.isAlive()`)

After the thread has terminated it is said to be killed. And also when **a thread has terminated can't be restarted**

### sleep

We can stop the execution(actually sleep to execution) by calling the static method called `Thread.sleep(milliseconds)`. **A sleeping thread is still alive, but it is not running**. And while thread is sleeping, computer can work on any other threads (or on other programs). And if you observe (already), sleep method throws an exception called `InterruptedException`. This exception is thrown when a thread is interrupted while it is sleeping. Therefore we have to write `Thread.sleep()` in the `try ... catch` block.

### Interrupt

One thread can interrupt another thread to wake it up when it is sleeping or paused for certain other reasons. For instance if we have an object `thread` with type of `Thread`, then this object can be interrupted by calling the method: `thread.interrupt()`. By calling this method we can send a signal from one thread to another.

A thread knows it has been interrupted when it catches an **InterruptedException**

### join

Sometimes, we have to wait for another thread to die. We can do this by calling `join()` method. If we have an thread object called `thread`, then if another thread object `thread2` calls the `thread.join()`, then `thread2` will go to sleep until `thread` terminates. The `join()` also throwns an **InterruptedException**, we have to write `thread.join()` in the `try ... catch` block. `join()` can also take maximum number of milliseconds to wait. A call to thread.join(m) will wait until either thread has terminated or until m milliseconds have elapsed (or until the waiting thread is interrupted).

### deamon thread

> a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

We can also set the thread as deamon thread by calling `thread.setDaemon(true)`. (But we should do this before calling the `start()` method of the thread)

> Actually Java offers two types of threads: user threads and daemon threads

Deamon threads is used to provide some services to user threads. And because they are serving to the user threads, after all user threads are done, deamons threads will be terminated automatically by the JVM

### thread priority

Every thread has also **priority** (specified as an integer). A thread with a greater priority value will be run in preference to a thread with a smaller priority. This can be useful especially for GUI programs. We can set the thread priority by calling the `thread.setPriorprity()`

However we can not set the random integer. Integer value must be the range between `Thread.MIN PRIORITY` and `Thread.MAX PRIORITY`

### current thread

We can also get the current thread by calling the static method `Thread.currentThread()`. This method returns a reference to itself.

## Mutual Exclusion with synchronized keyword

<img src="/assets/java/threads_in_java/mutual_exclusion.png" alt="mutual_exclusion.png" />

In the multi-thread program the problem arises when threads have to interact with the same sharing resources. Consider the following statement:

```java
count = count + 1;
```

This operation is actually composed of 3 operations:

1. Get the value of count
2. Add 1 to the value
3. Store the new value in count

And suppose that each thread performs these 3 steps. Remember, itâ€™s possible that processor to switch from one thread to another at any point. (And also running the code simultaneously).

Suppose that while one thread is between Step 2 and Step 3, another thread starts executing the same sequence of steps.

Since the first thread has not yet stored the new value in count, the second thread
reads the old value of count and adds one to that old value.

Both threads have computed the same new value for count, and both threads then go on to store that value back into count by executing Step 3.

After both threads have done so, the value of count has gone up only by 1 instead of by 2!. This type of problem is called a **race condition**.

### Race Condition

> NOTE: A race condition generally happens in the "Check-and-update" cases

A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. For the our _count_ example, the first thread is **in a race** to complete all the steps (totally 3 steps) before it is interrupted by another thread.

Let's do it an another example to understand better. Let's say we have the following java code:

```java
private Map<String, String> myBag = new HashMap(); // shared variable

// thread 1's run method
if (!myBag.containsKey("laptop")) { // instruction 1 (for thread 1)
    myBag.put("laptop", "msi"); // instruction 2 (for thread 1)
}

// thread 2's run method
if (!myBag.containsKey("laptop")) { // instruction 1 (for thread 2)
    myBag.put("laptop", "lenovo"); // instruction 2 (for thread 2)
}
```

And two threads are trying to put value with the same key but different values. Because we can't know the which operation will be done at time n, computer may run the following instructions:

<img src="/assets/java/threads_in_java/race_condition_case_1.png" alt="race_condition_case_1">

With this case we have no problem, becase I have already a msi-laptop, i don't need to add another laptop in my bag.

However computer may run the following instructions as well:

<img src="/assets/java/threads_in_java/race_condition_case_2.png" alt="race_condition_case_2.png">

Now with this case, **even i know that i added msi laptop in my bag, it will be changed by the second thread (because T2 knows(or we can say assumes) that there is no laptop).**

We can solve this problem by giving **exclusive access** to a thread. In Java we can do this by using **synchronized** keyword.

**synchronized** is used to protect shared resources by making sure that only one thread at a time will try to access the resource. And once a thread starts executing statements inside the synchronized keyword, it is guaranteed that it will finish executing it, until the finish time no other thread can access it.

For our counter example, we can wrap the counter operation in the class with synchronized keyword:

```java
public class MyCounter {
    private int count = 0;

    synchronized public void increment() {
        count = count + 1;
    }

    synchronized public int getValue() {
        return count;
    }
}

public static void main(...) {
    MyCounter myCounter = new MyCounter();
    thread1.run(() => myCounter.increment());
    thread2.run(() => myCounter.increment());
}
```

With this way, we guarantee that increment operation will be done only one thread at a time.

However there can be also a race condition according to the other operation(s) related to the count value. For instance:

```java
if (myCounter.getValue() == 10) {
        doSomething();
}
```

This code block is also vulnerable to race condition, because there is chance for thread2 to change counter (`myCounter.increment()`) while thread1 is executing the if's body. To resolve that we can update the code like:

```java
synchronized(myCounter) {
    if (myCounter.getValue() == 10) {
        doSomething();
    }
}
```

In general the rule of synchronization is:

- **Two threads cannot be synchronized on the same object at the same time**. In other words:

  - Threads can not simultaneously execute code segments that are synchronized on that object.
  - If one thread is synchronized on an object, and a second thread tries to synchronize on the same object, the second thread is forced to wait until the first thread has finished with the object.
  - For instance, there are two different synchronized methods in the counter object. If T1 has the lock for the method1, event T2 only needs to call method2, T2 should wait until T1 releases the lock.

- Synchronization is implemented using **synchronization lock**. Every object has a synchr. lock, and that lock can be held by only one thread at a time.

- To enter a synchronized statement or synchronized method, a thread must obtain the associated objectâ€™s lock.

- If the lock is available, then the thread obtains the lock and immediately begins executing the synchronized code.

- Thread releases the lock after it finishes executing the synchronized code.

Although synchronization can help us to prevent race conditions, it introduces another error called **deadlock**

## Deadlock

- A deadlock occurs when a thread waits forever for a resource that it will never get.

Consider two chefs need cup and milk at the same time to cook. Let's assume that chef1 grabs the milk (with adding synchronization lock) and the other (chef2) grabs the cup.

- Now chef1 needs a cup to start cook (and to release the lock) but chef2 has the lock for the milk.
- And also chef2 needs a milk to start cook (And to release the lock) but chef1 has the lock for the cup
- Neither chef can continue to cook and nothing more gets done. This situation is called **deadlock**

In software world, deadlock can occur if two threads need to lock on the same two objects (like milk and cup).

## Volatile (likely to change suddenly and unexpectedly) variables

<img src="/assets/java/threads_in_java/volatile_keyword.png" alt="volatile_keyword.png" />

In general, communication with sharing variables among thread can be done with synchronized methods or synchronized statements. However, synchronization is fairly expensive. And also in some cases, thread may only refer to shared variables without synchronizing their access to those variables.

The other problem (even it is rare) can be seen after a shared variable updated (or set) by one thread(T1) and used in another thread (T2). Because threads are allowed to **cache shared data**, threads can keep theirs own local copy of the shared data, then thread T2 may not see the changes (done by T1) immediately.

> Actually it is safe to use shared variable in a synchronized method (or statements) and there will be no problem (for instance caching the data), it is guaranteed that if in the synchronized method value is changed by T1, then T2 will get the new data **AS LONG AS SYNCHRONIZATION OPERATION IS DONE ON THE SAME OBJECT**

If we want to use a shared variable safely outside of synchronized code, the shared variable must be declared as **volatile**. For instance:

```java
private volatile int count;
```

<img src="/assets/java/threads_in_java/volatile_and_local_cache.png" alt="volatile_and_local_cache.png" />

In other words, any change that is made to the variable will immediately visible to all threads.

> Be careful, using a only volatile variable doesn't solve race condition. Because there is chance to be interrupted by another thread(T2), while thread T1 is incrementing the counter.

Also be aware of that only the variable itself is volatile not the contents that the variable points to. Therefore it is good to declare simple types or immutable types (such as `String`) as volatile variables.

We can use volatile variables to send signal from one thread to another.

## Atomic Variables

In the parallel programming generally problem arises when we have statement like `count = count + 1`. Because that statement contains 3 operations there is chance for interruption by another thread while the current thread is running the statement.

**atomic** operation is something that can't be interrrupted. It is all-or-nothing. Atomic operation can't be done partly.

Java provides class called `java.util.concurrent.atomic` for the simple types. We can use atomic types without synchronized keyword. For instance, we can define an AtomicInteger:

```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();

count.addAndGet(num)
```

When Thread wants to add num to the count, it can use the `addAndGet` method. This is an atomic operation which can't be interrupted by another threads.

However be careful about atomic variables, because atomic variables doesn't solve all race conditions. For instance the following condition may suffer from the race condition:

```java
int currentCounter = counter.addAndGet(x);
System.out.println("Current count is " + currentCounter);
```

Because it is possible while output statement is executed, the total counter could have been changed by another thread.

If we summarize:

<img src="/assets/java/threads_in_java/thread_communication_summarize.png" alt="thread_communication_summarize.png">

---

In parallel programming, we are just dividing our tasks to more subtasks that can be handled by different processors. At the end we are aiming to reduce the spending time. But let's assume that we divide tasks into 2 subtasks but second task takes too much time rather than first task 1 and let's assume that computer, running the threads, has only 2 CPU and we assume that each thread is working on different CPU. Now because second task needs too much time (on CPU-2), even CPU-1 is empty (assume that first task's operation is done) we can't use the it. Instead of reducing the computational time by half, we are just waiting CPU-2. Therefore we should do the followings:

- Divide task into the subtasks (almost) equally, (nor one subtask is too big neither one subtask is too small)
- Use all available CPUs. (We should keep them as busy as possible)

While the first one is depends on your architecture, we can do that the second one by using the concept thread pools.

## Thread Pools

Now our aim is keeping the CPU busy as much as possible. To do that we have to assign subtask if there is any available processor(s). In other words, we should do **load balancing**, _the computational load should be balanced among the available processors in order to keep them all as busy as possible._

<img src="/assets/java/threads_in_java/load_balancing.png" alt="load_balancing.png" />

<br />
But the question is how should we assing subtasks to threads?

We know that there is `run()` method to run thread's task. However in this case, thread must know its task before starting itself. Well, **instead of assinging tasks to threads, we can assing threads to tasks. There can be tasks pool then each thread will get the task from the pool and run it**.

Then, we have to create many threads and assing tasks to them. When several threads are available for performing tasks, those threads are called a **thread pool**. We will use thread pool to avoid creating a new thread for each task. When a task needs to be performed, it can be assigned to any idle thread in the pool. And if all threads are working on theirs tasks, any additional task waits until one of threads in the pool becomes idle. Actually this is queue. When new task available we are adding to the queue, after thread execute the task we are removing from the queue.

As you can guess, because queue will be shared among all threads, there is chance to encounter race condition. (For instance, two threads may get the same tasks and perform the same operation twice). Then synchronization is essential.

Java provides nice API to work with thread pool. It is called **ExecutorService**

### ExecutorService

- ExecutorService defines services that can execute tasks that are submitted to it.
- ExecutorService has static methods such as `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n)` (where n is the number of threads in the thread pool) ...

For instance if we want to run one thread per available CPU:

```java
int processors = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(processors);
```

- `executor.execute(task)` can be used to submit a Runnable object, task, for execution.
  - The method returns immediately after placing task into a queue of waiting tasks.
  - Threads in the thread pool remove tasks from the queue and execute them.
- `executor.shutdown()` tells the thread pool to shut down after all waiting tasks have been executed.
  - The method returns immediately, without waiting for the threads to finish.

ExecutorService can also be represented by objects of type `Callable<T>`, which is a parameterized functional interface that defines the method call() with no parameters and a return type of T. A Callable represents a task that outputs a value.

A Callable, c, can be submitted to an ExecutorService by calling `executor.submit(c)`. The Callable will then be executed at some future time. We can get the value by using `Future<T>` The method `executor.submit(c)` returns a Future that represents the result of the future computation.

A `Future` defines several methods:

- `future.isDone()`, which is a boolean-valued function that can be called to check whether the result is available
- `future.get()`, which will retrieve the value of the future. The method `future.get()` will block until the value is available. It can also generate exceptions and needs to be called in a `try..catch` statement.

For instance, we can refactor our prime number counter with the Executor, Callable and Future:

- Here are the methods for the counting the primes:

```java
public class CountPrimeExecutor {
    private final static int START = 5000000;
    // ...

    private static int countPrimes(int min, int max) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = min; i <= max; i++)
            if (isPrime(i))
                count++;
        return count;
    }

    private static boolean isPrime(int x) {
        if (x <= 1) return false;
        int top = (int)Math.sqrt(x);
        for (int i = 2; i <= top; i++)
            if ( x % i == 0 )
                return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```

- Now, let's define the a class to implement Callable

```java
public class CountPrimeExecutor {
    // ...

    private static class CountPrimesTask implements Callable<Integer> {
        private final int min;
        private final int max;
        public CountPrimesTask(int min, int max) {
            this.min = min;
            this.max = max;
        }

        @Override
        public Integer call() throws Exception {
            return countPrimes(min, max);
        }
    }
}
```

- The rest is just defining the main methods:

```java
public class CountPrimeExecutor {
    private final static int START = 5000000;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // do not add too many subtasks, it may lead to overload on the CPUs
        int numberOfTasks = 100;
        System.out.println("\nCounting primes between " + (START+1) + " and "
                + (2*START) + " using " + numberOfTasks + " tasks...\n");
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

        // size of a subtask
        double increment = (double)START/numberOfTasks;

        // create fixed thread pool
        int processors = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(processors);

        // create list to store Futures
        List<Future<Integer>> results = new ArrayList<>();

        int min = START+1;  // The start of the range of integers for one subtask.
        int max;            // The end of the range of integers for one subtask.
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTasks; i++) {
            max = (int)(START+1 + (i+1)*increment);
            if (i == numberOfTasks-1) {
                max = 2*START;
            }
            CountPrimesTask oneTask = new CountPrimesTask(min, max);
            // available thread(s) will get the new task immediately after we submit it.
            Future<Integer> oneResult = executor.submit(oneTask);
            // Save the Future representing the (future) result.
            results.add(oneResult);
            min = max + 1;
        }

        // Executor has to be shut down
        executor.shutdown();
        System.out.println("Shutdown has called waiting for all subtasks ...");

        // get the total result from each task's result
        int total = 0;
        for ( Future<Integer> res : results) {
            try {
                total += res.get();  // Waits for task to complete!
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Error occurred while computing: " + e);
            }
        }

        long elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        System.out.println("\nThe number of primes is " + total + ".");
        System.out.println("\nTotal elapsed time:  " + (elapsedTime/1000.0) + " seconds.\n");
    }

    private static class CountPrimesTask implements Callable<Integer>  {/* ...*/}

    private static int countPrimes(int min, int max) { {/* ...*/}}

    private static boolean isPrime(int x) {/* ...*/}
}

```

Here is the result after running the code in my computer:

```text
Counting primes between 5000001 and 10000000 using 100 tasks...

Shutdown has called waiting for all subtasks ...

The number of primes is 316066.

Total elapsed time:  0.699 seconds.
```

Let's talk about how we can send notification from one thread to another using wait() and notify()

## wait and notify

Sometimes, a second thread has to be wait answer from first thread. This can impose some restrictions such as order of threads.

If a second thread needs to get result from first thread and there is no result, then second thread have to stop and wait for the result to be produced. When the result is ready and second thread is notified, then it can continue its execution.

Java provides methods on the `Object` class called `wait() & notify()Ì€`.

> These methods (wait and notify) are low-level, error-phone. It would be better to use higher-level control strategies such as blocking queue.

> wait can also be called with `wait(milliseconds)` => wait until amount of milliseconds

When a thread calls a **wait()** method in some object, that thread goes to sleep until the **notify()** method in the same object is called.

<img src="/assets/java/threads_in_java/wait_and_notify.png" alt="wait_and_notify.png" />

It is not an error to call notify() when no one is waiting; it just has no effect.

For instance, Thread A can execute the following code:

```java
if (!isResultAvailable()) {
    obj.wait() // wait for notification
}
doSomethingWithResult(); // otherwise execute the code
```

and thread B can have the following code;

```java
generateTheResult();
obj.nofity();
```

Even these codes seem simple, there is race condition when:

1. Thread A checks resultIsAvailable() and finds that the result is not ready, so it decides to execute the obj.wait() statement, but before it does,
2. Thread B finishes generating the result and calls obj.notify()
3. Thread A calls obj.wait() to wait for notification that the result is ready. (forever !!!)

The solution is to enclose both Thread Aâ€™s code and Thread Bâ€™s code in synchronized statements. Also Java makes an absolute requirement to call notify and wait in the synchronized statements

Let's do it a simple example:

- Assume that there is a variable called `sharedResult` that is used to transfer the result from the producer thread to the consumer thread.
  - When the result is ready, the producer sets the variable to a non-null value.
  - The consumer can check whether the result is ready by testing whether the value of sharedResult is null.

Now let's use variable named **lock** for synchronization. The code for the producer thread could be like this:

```java
result = generateResult(); // Not synchronized!
synchronized(lock) {
    sharedResult = result;
    lock.notify();
}
```

The code for the consumer thread could be like this:

```java
synchronized(lock) {
    while ( sharedResult == null ) {
        try {
            lock.wait();
        }
        catch (InterruptedException e) {
        }
    }
    useResult = sharedResult;
}
useTheResult(useResult); // Not synchronized!
```

> Since sharedResult is a shared variable, all references to sharedResult should be synchronized, so the references to sharedResult must be inside the synchronized statements

Well, you may say that **if consumer thread will wait for the result after synchronized on the lock, then how consumer thread will release the synchronization lock to give a chance to producer thread to produce result?**. In fact, lock.wait() is a special case: When a thread calls lock.wait(), it gives up the lock that it holds on the synchronization object.

Instead of one sharedResult, there could be many shared variables between many producers and consumers. Now here is the simple implementation for that:

```java
public class MyLinkedBlockingQueue {
  private LinkedList <Runnable> taskList = new LinkedList <Runnable> ();
  public void clear() {
    synchronized(taskList) {
      taskList.clear();
    }
  }
  public void add(Runnable task) {
    synchronized(taskList) {
      taskList.addLast(task);
      taskList.notify();
    }
  }
  public Runnable take() throws InterruptedException {
    synchronized(taskList) {
      while (taskList.isEmpty())
        taskList.wait();
      return taskList.removeFirst();
    }
  }
}
```

Finally if you want to notify all the threads that is waiting on obj, you have to use `obj.notifyAll()`. Because `obj.notify()` will notify only one of the threads that is waiting on obj.
