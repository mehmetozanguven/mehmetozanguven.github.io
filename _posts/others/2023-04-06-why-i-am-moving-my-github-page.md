After careful consideration, I have decided to move my GitHub page to my own domain, [mehmetozanguven.com](https://mehmetozanguven.com/). This has been a long-standing idea that I have finally decided to act upon. It is time to take this step and make my online presence truly my own. Actually that was the main reason because mehmetozanguven.github.io isn't my domain at all belongs to the github.

##Â What will change ?

My new website is built by Hugo static site generator. (This one is using Jeklly) And I believe, maintaning the site build by Hugo is much more easier than Jeklly.

URL format will also be changed. I don't like the url style **https://mehmetozanguven.github.io/java/2022/07/02/threads-in-java.html**. I don't want to see date in the url instead **https://mehmetozanguven.com/java/threads-in-java.html**

In addition, I am excited to announce that my new website templates will include robust support for categories and tags. This feature is crucial for me because the current method of document organization has made it difficult to find specific documents. With the addition of search functionality, users will be able to quickly locate the information they need. These improvements will greatly enhance the usability and accessibility of my website.

## SEO concerns

Actually I don't care seo too much. But in the end this website and the new one will suffer from seo perspective. To be able move seemsly, I decided to move all blogs part by part and while moving the any blog i am adding the following links into old one:

- `<link rel="canonical" href="https://mehmetozanguven.com/">`
- `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url={{ page.newUrl }}">` newUrl points to the mehmetozanguven.com/...

I hope that these changes will not significantly impact your experience as an audience member.

I look forward to seeing you on my new website and continuing to provide valuable content for you to enjoy
